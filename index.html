                        div was used as a general-purpose element to create things from headers to footers to articles.
                        With
                        Semantic HTML we were introduced to elements that tell developers and browsers exactly what it
                        does and
                        what content should go in it.

                        that
                        point to the same element. When determining which rule to apply, the selector with the highest
                        specificity wins out. The most specific selector type is the ID selector, followed by class
                        selectors,
                        followed by type selectors. In this example, only color: blue will be implemented as it has an
                        ID
                        selector whereas color: red has a type selector.

                        sixteen
                        different values using 0-9 and a-f.

                        Hexadecimal colors are composed of 6 characters–each group of two represents a value between 0
                        and 255
                        for red, green, or blue. For example #ff0000 is all red, no green, and no blue.

                        When both characters of all three colors are repeated, hex colors can be abbreviated to only
                        three
                        values, so #0000ff could also be represented as #00f.
